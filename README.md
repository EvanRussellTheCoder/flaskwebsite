# flaskwebsite
So, I made this website by using a python extension called "Flask", which permitted the collaboration of python and html
I run this website by using a service called Heroku, which is an online platform that assists with back end development of applications
This website is nothing too crazy yet, I don't really know what to do with it. I'll figure something out eventually, though :)
